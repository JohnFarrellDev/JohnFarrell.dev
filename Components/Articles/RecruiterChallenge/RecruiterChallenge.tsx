              On LinkedIn, I keep seeing the same claims made that I am a bit
              doubtful about.

              * The study must share its data and methodology (any standard
              published trustworthy study is fine). Your source can't be an
              article that makes the claim without providing a source (that's
              how we got here). There can only be one winner, whoever provides
              proof first wins.

              <Paragraph>
                I would never take a counter offer but there are multiple
                factors for why a person should or shouldn't that are personal
                to them.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                I empathise with recruiters who have done all the work, now
                expecting their sweet commission to come in and at the last
                second it is yoinked from them.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                That being said I don't think telling people they are going to
                end up still not liking their job on an un-sourced claim is a
                good argument. An additional point is that even if someone does
                leave a job 6-12 months after accepting a counter offer it does
                not mean they made a mistake accepting the counter offer.
